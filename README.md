#   PRODUCT LANDING PAGE â€“ RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN COURSE

This is the sixth notable build on this course producing a landing page for a product.

In this build I used code that I have already learned so it was super easy to build. 

I learnt some new code in this build relating to in-bedding a video onto the page.

This is one of the projects was accessed to achieve the certificate for the responsive web design course.

Thanks for reading!
